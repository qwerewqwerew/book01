The jekyll-theme supports tips, warnings, and dangers blocks and the style is referred
from [the discord.js website][1].

You could have the following [markdown attributes (supported by kramdown)][2]:

### Tips

Using a `{: .block-tip}` attribute:

```markdown
> ##### TIP
>
> This guide is last tested with @napi-rs/canvas^0.1.20, so make sure you have
> this or a similar version after installation.
{: .block-tip }
```
